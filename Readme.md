 # What is this?
 This repository hosts my solutions to the problems enclosed in `programming_challenges.pdf`. This is intended as a learning excersise, so solutions will not be perfect or optimal. This is public to enable others to view my solutions, and to consider how they may have solved the problem. 
 
 It is worth noting that some of the solutions hosted here are still work in progress, so if something is complete or non-functional that is probably the case.
 
 I am open to feedback on my solutions should you wish to give it.
